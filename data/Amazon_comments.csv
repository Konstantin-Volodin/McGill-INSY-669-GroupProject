Good offering of events to attend and courses to learn for free by Amazon. Partial reimbursements on expenses such as travel, etc. Never really heard or saw someone getting pip'd. I think the people that get pip'd are the ones who make posts majority of the time. Got tickets to go to local fair Playland by Amazon which was nice since I recently joined.

- Diverse teams and lots of problem solving on a daily basis","- You will work 60+ hours a week including driving to and from the FCs. Shift is 10 hours, however during the busy seasons and if you are in the middle of projects this can jump to 14-15 hour days. There were many days that I would see managers above my level spend in excess of 20 hours at the FC in a 24 hour period. 
- Terrible support processes (HR doesn't know wtf they are doing EVER, and they never listen to or support Operations in a helpful way). Manager HR processes are treated the same way that Associates are, and they are extremely unhelpful. Complaints with HR systems are met with ""well why don't you come up with a better process"" like, that is not my job I'm not HR. 
- The long term goal of being successful in Operations is to be a Project/Program Manager, however the amount of work that is put on Operations as a whole does not justify the compensation. You will manage teams of 200+ Associates and be expected to cater to all of their individual needs. 
- Difficult to move laterally within the company with support of your direct manager. Some managers will actively block transfers and call it ""business need"" decisions. 
- Senior Managers are generally just towing the company line, and never really provide a lot of value (esp. when you never see them on the floor – they will claim this is because they have a lot of calls, so it is designed from the regional level that they do not know about things). 
- Direct Managers are either overwhelmed to the point of not caring, or recently taking on roles which they do not have the proper training for. Best practices from a centralized corporate lens are not shared with new managers so the ramp up is steep for them. 
- Safety leadership obsesses over the smallest detail while leaving mould growing in the water tanks where everyone is supposed to refill their water bottles while in the facility. Incidents will happen and the blame is never put on the individual, but rather the process in which they are working and if they were engaged enough while working. It's like working in a daycare.","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Vancouver, BC","Jun. 9, 2022"
