All the Amazonians I've met are friendly and kind. The Ad space is interesting, the team is taking on a new project and tech stack which is great. I had a few team lunches already at a few restaurants by the office. Currently hybrid model of working with two days in the office and rest work from home per week. However, I enjoy coming to the office everyday. There's a happy hour every Thursday to chat with people from other teams. Lots to learn and a big code base, still learning most of the systems, tools, culture, etc. Majority of co-workers in the entire office are young or middle age people, so everyone is easy to get along, not saying older people aren't lol. Good offering of events to attend and courses to learn for free by Amazon. Partial reimbursements on expenses such as travel, etc. Never really heard or saw someone getting pip'd. I think the people that get pip'd are the ones who make posts majority of the time. Got tickets to go to local fair Playland by Amazon which was nice since I recently joined. No specific time to start work or leave work, although they are some set daily meetings. I usually like to come to the office before 10 am and leave at 6 pm anyways, so I learn as much as possible.","Snacks are brought in by managers sometimes and usually last a few weeks. Although they are not regularly offered by Amazon. Would be nice to get meals but not bothered by this much. Not much else I could think of at this time.

- Nice bonus system in the first two years 
- Lots of room for growth in the company, provided you live up to Sr Manager's expectations for current roles 
- Diverse teams and lots of problem solving on a daily basis","- You will work 60+ hours a week including driving to and from the FCs. Shift is 10 hours, however during the busy seasons and if you are in the middle of projects this can jump to 14-15 hour days. There were many days that I would see managers above my level spend in excess of 20 hours at the FC in a 24 hour period. 
- Terrible support processes (HR doesn't know wtf they are doing EVER, and they never listen to or support Operations in a helpful way). Manager HR processes are treated the same way that Associates are, and they are extremely unhelpful. Complaints with HR systems are met with ""well why don't you come up with a better process"" like, that is not my job I'm not HR. 
- The long term goal of being successful in Operations is to be a Project/Program Manager, however the amount of work that is put on Operations as a whole does not justify the compensation. You will manage teams of 200+ Associates and be expected to cater to all of their individual needs. 
- Difficult to move laterally within the company with support of your direct manager. Some managers will actively block transfers and call it ""business need"" decisions. 
- Senior Managers are generally just towing the company line, and never really provide a lot of value (esp. when you never see them on the floor – they will claim this is because they have a lot of calls, so it is designed from the regional level that they do not know about things). 
- Direct Managers are either overwhelmed to the point of not caring, or recently taking on roles which they do not have the proper training for. Best practices from a centralized corporate lens are not shared with new managers so the ramp up is steep for them. 
- Safety leadership obsesses over the smallest detail while leaving mould growing in the water tanks where everyone is supposed to refill their water bottles while in the facility. Incidents will happen and the blame is never put on the individual, but rather the process in which they are working and if they were engaged enough while working.

Amazon is a large MNC with over 1.5M employees worldwide. As such, there are micro cultures depending on what team/organization you join. I'm a corporate employee, and I can state that much of the stuff you hear in the media is not true. I have found that I'm surrounded by amazing colleagues you are smart and driven. There is a major focus on diversity and inclusiveness and many processes in place to reduce bias in hiring, day to day operations, promotions etc. My direct leader is very technical and engaged and manages by objectives (given targets to hit in terms of project deliveries). The pace of work is fast! You are expected to deliver results. There are weeks in which my work-life balance is negative and there are weeks my work-life balance is very positive. This is the nature of a technology role (irrespective of company). Overall, if you are good at what you do and can manage your time...I have found my work-life balance to be good. You will get what you put in. If you are dedicated to the job and the organization…you can really do well at Amazon. Ultimately, I'm working on cutting edge projects for arguably one of the top companies on the planet....its not easy but I can say that my job is absolutely rewarding! Did I make the right choice in joining Amazon? ABSOLUTELY!","Large organization and it takes time to learn all the processes, teams, micro cultures etc. The ramp up period will be longer than other organizations because of the size of the organization and many cool projects that you will get to work on.","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Toronto, ON","Mar. 15, 2022"

Compensation wise the company may favor new hires more than seasoned employees with valuable contributions. To move to a different team/role it's not possible to change level, even if the new team strongly thinks you're worth the next level. The only way is to quit, wait (I believe) over 6 months and then interview again. A new hire will get the level but if you're already an employee it's not possible without the formal and very long process of promotion. This applies to changes from engineering to management level, where for example level 5 engineering is not junior but level 5 management is junior.

Onboarding is packed with information. There are tonnes of resources at your disposal.

Small teams own a given service or services, which eliminates much of the burocracy of working at a typical large corporate entity, and empowers team members to make meaningful change. There is a lot of freedom of choice, and team members are encouraged to challenge the status-quo to do what's best for the customer / long-term. Most of the tools / services used are internal, so if you need help with using one, or spot an issue, you can reach out to the team that owns it.

Depending on the warehouse you work at and your position, you might be able to listen to music lowkey which will make the shifts fly by.
Job is good for young people who just want some quick money that can handle labor-intensive work. 
you start off as temporary but when you're eventually made permanent you get PTO (paid time off) privileges which is nice I guess.
The people you meet aren't that bad.","Grueling 10-hour shifts.
expectations to hit high rates, the rate depends on the warehouse and position but honestly what I was doing was so easy and repetitive I naturally got faster.
Potential health issues may arise depending on your age, me being 18, I didn't really face any issues but the job is labor-intensive at the start until you’re used to it.
The temperature of the warehouse may be too hot for some people so just make sure to drink a lot of water.
Managers do seem to be racially biased when it comes to appointing certain associates for jobs with more responsibilities but this is what I experienced at my warehouse, others might differ.
Where there are rates there are pushy managers, some are understanding, some aren't, can you get fired for not hitting the rates? Possibly but again this depends on a couple of factors, in my department (packing) I've never heard of anyone getting fired for missing rate goals but I've seen people moved to positions with easier rate targets.
for these kinds of low barrier of entry jobs, of course, the benefits are nonexistent, for the entry-level position at least.
Dead-end job? you could grind for higher positions but it's unpredictable how long it would take.
Depending on the time of the year you might be forced to work 50-60 hours for the week or even month like during December, prime day, black Friday weekend, etc.","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Brampton, ON","Jul. 17, 2021"

Point's system is ridiculous. 
As seasonal staff there are no accommodations for any sickness without accruing attendance points towards termination. I was off sick for two days and had to go home from an additional shift because of an upset stomach. My sickness led me to go over the 6 points needed for termination. (I'm awaiting to be told what happens next!) You either have to grin-and-bear-it or go look after yourself and potentially lose your job. 
The job itself is the most soul destroying thing ever. Everything is timed and everything questioned. There are unattainable metrics used that sees staff having to pick items within a stupid amount of time. If you scan the wrong thing or scan out of sequence then you're threatened with having to be retrained. They don't allow for any human error. You are a number, somebody that is not hired for their brain but their body. 
Nobody talks to one another which creates an uncomfortable and lonely working environment. I tried numerous times to enter into conversation with people, but received no response. The job itself can be really lonely too. 

I do not understand how anybody can make this into a career. There are very few selling points. While Bezos is earning billions, I have to weigh up if its worth going home and risking termination because I'm vomiting.","Current Employee, less than 1 year",,"Dec. 25, 2020"

3. The first day they put us into groups of about 5 people and assigned each group an Ambassador who gave us a tour and trained us in one of the departments. We were randomly assigned which departments we would be trained in. Training happens for about a day and half and then you are on your own. However, over time there will be coaches that will come by and give you feedback on how to improve your work. Co-workers are usually friendly and are open to help out new people if they need it. 
4. You get two half hour breaks. One of them is paid and the other you have to punch out for so it's unpaid.
5. Work days are 10.5 hours long but that allows you to have 3 days off instead of 2
6. Many offers for unpaid voluntary time off for times when you just want to rest at home.
7. Safety shoes can be required if you are in the shipping department or are handling a manual pallet jack. But most departments you are allowed to wear regular shoes.","1. Your whole day is spent at work and then it's late evening by the time you get home.

Bad communication throughout teams, areas.

Chaos in maintaining old solutions or very slow and hacky to moving to new solutions.

Not cutting edge technology at all. Maan, if you think Amazon is supposed to be a very cool tech company with the newest tech and newest cloud-based lightweight tricks, no. It's super old. You won't progress. If you leave Amazon you'll be having this big name on your resume and no knowledge of current technologies, you will s_ck at frameworks, languages, take-home assignments, new protocols, tools.

They have a continuous lay-off plan going on. Every half year or year they will kick out one member of your team, and you could be that person. It's called dev plan, dev list, coaching plan, any name and then another step after that is PIP. PIP is impossible to get out of. Coaching plan is 60-70% lay-off possibility. They don't care about outliers, if you're an exception or a good engineer just couldn't show results. If your manager is against you, you stand no chance. If he/she's with you, he/she is risking themselves to be laid off.

Everyone is on themselves, on their own. You all pray to stay and be all right.

Promotion documents are hard to make and you have to be a friend of your manger to be promoted, you'll wait a looot.

Principles are bullsh_t. The only principle Amazon has is Deliver Results.

On-call hours in some teams are very very hard. You'll be called so many times with hard problems you can't solve or finish in time. Some AWS teams have over 20 issues in a week that have to be handled within 15 minutes and solved as fast as you can.

Amazon is very cheap. You don't get perks. You get the cheapest hotels if you go for a meeting in another city, IF you manage to book in time. You don't get raises or bonuses. Some teams can get a team budget approved for a nice one-day fun but some teams don't do this at all.

Well, it was that while it lasted... The job was very simple and there was a lot of independence. You really didn't need to speak to anyone if you didn't want to, and on top of that, the warehouse environment felt very safe and secure. There were two short breaks and one longer, 30-minute break. Also, extended medical benefits (dental and vision, from what I remember) were available from the first day on the job. Pay was above minimum wage and shifts were 10 hours each, so you could get three-day weekends.","Very, very impersonal work environment, to the point where being in the warehouse was slightly emotionally painful and felt toxic. I didn't realize this until after I left. The work was physically demanding: I am a woman and my back hurt while I was working there (I left because of this after a short time). There was no accommodation available and the medical personnel on-site was speculating diagnoses that minimized the pain I felt even though I explained that I had done everything I could do to fix it (insoles, heated blanket, ergonomic movements, muscle relaxant/painkiller). I also didn't have the option of taking more than a couple of days of unpaid time off though my back needed a week or two, at least. HR on that day was a young, mousy woman who whispered that I could be accommodated but when I tried to inquire about this possibility, the medical personnel (who was also there) stepped in and said there was no point ""if you are going to quit anyway."" I received an email a week or so later advising me that I had been terminated, even though I had quit and filled out an exit interview advising them of my problems/the reasons for leaving.

Get rated based on results not time spent on desk (but these results might force you to perform overtime).
Internal transfer are easy (unless a manager prevents you from it).

Work with mostly smart and funny people.","I have to preface this with saying that Amazon culture can apparently vary wildly depending on the team and org. I've only worked in one team two orgs myself. That being said, I think there are some things you might find to be fairly consistent across Amazon.

It's a Java shop with enormous legacy baggage, and mostly lacking in will and competency to change that. Yes, there are teams with a heavy emphasis on Go or Python, but once you go off the Java path you will find yourself having issues. With co-workers who are afraid of using other stuff and with existing infrastructure catering largely to Java devs. It's IMHO a legacy language, and people who are good at using it also IME usually come with a legacy mindset.

It's stingy. They call it frugal. It means it's up to you how to explain to your friends that you don't get a free or even discounted Prime subscription as a full-time employee. It's also up to you to figure out how to cut down your server pool even further every couple of weeks to save on operational costs. Amazon is famous for having an abysmal perk philosophy. Which would be great if you would instead get more salary compared to other big IT companies, but you don't.

It's political. Annoy the wrong senior manager and you're good to go on your path out. Managers have the means to control your career and well-being at the job. If you're a good little member of the sweatshop who doesn't voice their opinion you're probably good (although you still might find your promotion hard to achieve after 6 years on the job as an SDE2).

It's hypocritical. Leadership Principles sound awesome, but they get abused like there's no tomorrow. Like ""being a leader"" means to do overtime when required, not being able to have a say in things. Or ""make decisions based on data"" is fine if you're supposed to justify your decisions, but when you're about to get fired data matters little.","Current Employee, more than 1 year",,"Jun. 24, 2019"

- An insight into doing things massively, properly, at scale, and leading the industry
- Managers are usually ex-engineers. I've had 3 managers and they all have been fantastic
- An obvious one: Amazon is killing it lately and looks great on your resume. The long-term prospects are also good.
- Things do change internally
- Loved the corporate events and outings - shout out to the events team","- The nature of work itself in operations is absolutely horrendous. The only good thing about the role was transitioning out of the role: literally, every conversation I had with my managers, where I raised concerns, was turned into ""Work harder and get promoted out of this"" talk. Engineering-wise, this has been the most demotivational role in my career.
- Stress-driven operations. You're subjected to stress and that's how it's all meant to work.
- You're pushed to work extra: while it is not explicit, the annual performance reviews, career progression and customer obsession are designed in such a way, that you will fail without going overtime. I had committed a bulk of my personal time to get promoted once, succeeded – and it was totally not worth it. Very little had changed in terms of my work (or compensation for that matter), and the conversations with my manager then turned into ""Now, work harder and get promoted into the next thing"" (goto con #1).
- Pigeonhole - it's a big corporation and the roles are very well defined and specialized. I think you can really boil down any job spec to 3 main responsibilities that you will do day-to-day. Training is advertised and provided, however it will likely be after hours for you, as your time is already 120% full; and training is not how things are learned anyway – it's training+PRACTICE, and you won't be practising any of that at work – you will be right back in your pigeonhole after the training.
- An unpleasant surprise (or, borderline dirty move) in the way the stock benefits are accounted for in your annual reviews.

Overall, I would strongly recommend against getting on board if you're a junior or mid level professional – you will get way more technical experience and interesting projects in other companies. Here you will be selling your time for a big name on your resume (and then recovering your rusty technical skills later).","Former Employee, more than 3 years",,"Sep. 28, 2018"

- If you get injured and go to their medical unit, you'll be told just go back to work its ok.  Work condition there is border line unsafe.
- You may waste an entire break if you want to talk to HR, not enough HR reps to the number of people who have questions or concerns all the time.

I know quite a few people personally that can say they closed their businesses down directly because of Amazon.","Yes Amazon is cheap, but you get what you pay for if you want to destroy the economy.  Wayfair and Amazon both operate at a ridiculously low profit margin for any business. Looks like 1 to 4% profit... What's wrong with that you ask, ""they're not greedy"" you might think. They're killing retail stores by the 10,000 thousands per month in the USA alone. They're prices are actually so low that it leaves no possibility to Brick and Mortar retail stores of making any profit or matching prices. As a result, 30,000 people lost their jobs in one month alone in 2017... and over 10,000 businesses closed in ONE MONTH as a direct result of Amazon's price structure that used to hover around 4% profit... That's before Wayfair came around. Wayfair, to gain market on Amazon, has lowered theirs target profit to 1% and even slutting-out product at an even more ravaging rate to online competitors and retailers. Because of Wayfair's ultra aggressive approach and functioning at 0% profit after expenses for over 5 years, they're doing-in furniture stores, decorative item stores and so many more categories.

While working there I've had my takt time changed 3 times because they want us to do over 100%. Some people end up not doing their job properly because they are trying to hit their numbers and it ends up affecting your job. I and others have complained many times, but nothing gets done because to them productivity is the most important thing. Quality takes a back seat to quantity. You get two breaks one is an unpaid half hour and the other one is paid half hour, but with the paid break they don't want you leaving your station until one min before your break (even if you are far from the break room) and they want you back your station the minute the break is over. That means you have to leave before you break finishes. So if your station is a 5 min walk from the break room you end up losing 8-10 mins of your break.

I mean it did land my high paying job, but that also is dependent on how you advertise to your next employer how you did so much at amazon otherwise, DO NOT TAKE THE JOB.","This is by far the worst job I ever had. 

Salary: $25 an hour - a 10k signing bonus that is prorated – if you leave before the end of your year you have to pay it back (aka your stuck after taxes take half of it anyways). 25 stocks given, but that is also divided yearly. End of first year you get one measly stock, end of second year you get 3, end of third year you get 6 etc. 

There is no work life balance. You are given any shift they want to give you. You sign a contract stating they can change your shift without notice. I was  given the night shift and never changed. Even when a new member after me was hired she was given the morning shift because well everything is political in the warehouse. If you want to move up get “friendly” with your manager. If you ever speak out about the issues in the warehouse or your team, be warned they will put you on a development plan.

If I could describe working at Amazon in one word, it would be fear. Fear of going to the bathroom, fear of walking around on your break, fear of doing your job even. The amount of pressure and strain your body will take for standing 10 hours straight everyday will be the first reason as to why anyone would leave.  The competition is unreal. The way people will stare at you as if you were just born yesterday. The location that I worked at YYZ4, is entirely run by Indian people. 99.9% brown. Amazon runs on a point system so that means if you arrive to work late (even by minutes), leave early (even by minutes), or miss work for whatever reason, you get ""rewarded"" with a point. 6 points and your done. Safety doesnt exist because your numbers are what matters. Everything is done on a computer and/or tablet so everything is measured in numbers. You must achieve 100% everyday or you will be subject to termination. They will threaten your livelihood every single day. Eating in the cafeteria I like to call incredibly disturbing. You will get wicked looks and stares of disapproval from almost anyone.

ESOP","Discrimination in internal growth which means when u get hired initially as an associate there is no discrimination as they desperately need labourers but if u join with an intention to grow within there is hell lot of discrimination .
Whites bosses will promote white guys , religious discrimination ( a muslim manager will prefer muslim team members  and a Punjabi manager will prefer punjabi team members for promotion) . EVERY DEPARTMENT HAS THESE EXAMPLES IN YYZ4 , Diversity takes back seat here. 
Though for promotion you have interviews with other department managers but the managers are so well connected with each other that they put in a word of who to promote. Basically process and system gaps.
Also middle aged folks will not grow ( if u are in 40's and 50's), youngsters have a better chance,
They also don't value your past experience . for example if you have 10 years of experience in finance and there are finance opening, they wont shortlist u or will reject u if u don't have a strong referral or do not butter managers.
its been frustrating  to work here . sometime i feel like sharing all this with the management but get scared they may sack me .
They cannot recognize talent well for sure !!!
It is the corporate process and business growth which is running this business because the approach is process oriented and not people oriented except for internal growth.
Sheer discrimination in internal promotion specially in Brampton YYZ4.

empReview_12575747,SDE I,3.0,Amazon,negative,error,error,"- very smart coworkers, you raise your IQ by just chatting with them;
- good pay level;
- awesome level of work dedication;
- countless learning opportunities, technical challenges that are tackled on a daily basis are hard and fairly non-trivial;
- hard-working people all over the place means that everyone is focused on delivering, therefore standard communication overhead and bureaucracy that is typical for big companies is almost not present (feels pretty much like a startup). Not a place for slackers - they won't survive even a week. You end up contributing much more than you ever thought you are capable of, which is a good feeling and builds up a great confidence level in your skills (at the price of getting quite exhausted though).
- a good thing is that if you criticize against the work environment, no one will condemn you about it (aka there is no internal cult about Amazon), but will rather likely agree with you provided that you give some ideas for improvement - these are always very welcome, and if you are persistent and dedicated enough you can definitely have an impact, make a change, and this will be much appreciated;
- people generally respect you a lot, I've never felt underappreciated and under-acknowledged even for a moment.","- terrible work-life balance, working long hours is standard and although it is an 'unstated expectation' it is rather assumed that you have to do it;
- indescribably bad on-call, in some teams there are cases of people who quit after first couple of on-call shifts;
- some organizations are focused on revenue only, and ignore dealing with technical debt. Tolerating this year after year leads to extremely bad code base which is impossible to improve, and is therefore just left to be patched manually during on-call shifts. In other words, the focus is put on curing the symptoms rather than fixing the real root causes. This is a classical example of organizations that simply do not learn from their mistakes and their past experience;
- a key company value and tenet is to be extremely quick and fast with deliveries, which naturally comes at the cost of very poor to almost-zero quality. This is especially true for the case of terrible code bases, where pouring dozens of new features every month only exacerbates the problems and turns the on-call into a frantic clicking exercise, a manual maintenance of what is supposed to be an automatic service. The worst part is that next sprint you will be too busy to deliver even newer features, so you end up never taking care of fixing the already embarrassing v1 delivery from the previous sprint (that you thought to yourself ""ok, it's not great now, but I'll definitely stabilize/polish it later"" - actually this never happens).
- this naturally leads to a huge attrition rate, people come & go like in a supermarket ... Just look at the thousands of vacant SDE positions that Amazon has at every moment. The average time spent in the company is so short, that it all looks like this is some sort of a temporary seasonal job, rather than a serious engineering activity that is part of a well planned long-term career and professional growth. Part of the reason why this still works is that for foreign workers it is a great opportunity to get their immigration status secured (aka PR, green card, etc.) if they can survive long enough. For others a major incentive is probably the good stock options package, but it requires that you survive really long.","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Vancouver, BC","Nov. 6, 2016"

That's right, long waits for washrooms is the norm, and employees are sometimes encouraged to use nearby cafes to attend nature's urgent calls.

empReview_3211548,"Ownership culture, interesting technology, and a bright future",5.0,Amazon,positive,positive,positive,"Amazon is an amazing company - I haven't seen anything like it. It's a place where you're encouraged to ""Think Big"" while still having to focus on the details and deliver results. There are truly incredible people working here, and it's easy to reach across the organization and benefit from their knowledge. This is a company where displays of true ownership are rewarded. If you see a problem or an opportunity, don't wait for someone else to give you permission to look at it - go and see! Sure, you shouldn't go off for two weeks working on something new without telling anyone, but management is open to hearing about ideas about what needs to be done.

The Vancouver office is a ""remote"" office in that it's a few hours away from the corporate HQ in Seattle, but the culture here is very much Amazonian. The leadership principles are consistent across the company (although occasionally open to interpretation), and as we continue to grow the office feels more and more like a ""1st class"" Amazon office every day.

Amazon has had a bad reputation about operational load, but I can only speak to my own experience - the load is minimal. It is very rare that someone on my team gets paged because of an issue, and almost always that takes place during business time. Having the team handle operations, instead of sourcing it out to a dedicated support team, instills a strong quality ethic in the team and as a result the software is of much higher quality.","Amazon is great place, but it's also a huge and varied place. Your Amazon experience will depend largely on two things - how much of a self-started you are, and what team you're on. 

There are a lot of opportunities, but you need to reach out and grab them. Very little will be spoon-fed to you unless you are at the lowest levels, and even then there is an expectation of motivation and initiative (or ""bias for action""). Waiting for the action to come to you is not a successful strategy, be it interesting projects, new technologies, promotions, or anything else.

Amazon is relatively decentralized, meaning that it's up to each organization, division, and even manager to run their group the way they want. Sometimes things will be circumstantial - inheriting a legacy system, etc. - but often a manager's or organization's policies will greatly impact how much you like work here. Luckily, people are relatively free to move around within the company, so unhappy teams will bleed developers to teams with better reputations.","Current Employee, more than 1 year","Vancouver, BC","Oct. 21, 2013"

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.  You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned.  There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Phoenix, AZ","Feb. 23, 2018"

The culture is quick and hard charging.  You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.  This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon.  The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism.  Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.","Former Employee, more than 5 years","Seattle, WA","Mar. 23, 2017"

The company is large enough so often it's possible to relocate to another facility. It's a good employer for homeless people.","Extremely poor to no training, absolute lack of standardization and consistency, they use what they call ""High-judgement decision making"" to justify each individual decision based on subjective factor such as the manager's mood, their personality. The feeling I have is that the company is growing so much there is not enough qualified labor, so they just hire anyone. Then when they finally hire a good employee, they won't stay due to the total mess, disorganization and toxic environment. They treat their employees ruthlessly and they see them as numbers. People get fired for wrong reasons out of the blue and when the associate wants to explain why their termination was wrong, they don't give the right of appealing to everyone. Sometimes no one shows up for the appeal and they keep having to reschedule. The policies are outdated, that's WHEN they have at least a date so we can know which one is the most updated one. You ask dozens of employees from different departments for a simple answer and sometimes (very often to be honest) it is just impossible to find an answer. They say you should disagree and commit, but guess what happens when you give a manager feedback, even in the nicest way? They retaliate against you. One may say ""but they have a non-retaliation policy"". Do you know how hard it is to prove retaliatory behavior? They will do anything to protect management and the most you will get is ""oh, that is just their management style, we'll work on that"". If your manager works remotely, they will probably show up once a week or every other week for a half an hour discussion that is usually just a formality and no matter what you say, they are always too busy to follow up with your concerns. If you are an Amazonian that has ever tried to get HR support (especially if your building doesn't have an HR), you know how hard it can be to get your issue fixed. I have so many bad things to say about the company I feel sick just to think about them. Best day in years was when I decided to resign.

empReview_72297212,My favorite job of all I’ve had.,4.0,Amazon,positive,negative,error,"I work in an FC and have for 4+ years. I honestly love picking. Yes it’s a hard job, but it’s also simple. The hard part is the labor, the job itself is easy. I know I’m good at it and can exceed, which helps pass the time, as well as constantly seeing new and interesting things all day everyday! If you need an accommodation with whatever, they can be super helpful if you communicate effectively. They allow phones in the FC now since COVID which is HUGE for them. They provide food with an outside market available in break rooms and on the floor. It’s wonderful exercise; I may be sore and exhausted after work but I also feel good and look amazing. It’s awesome for weight management lol. You meet lots of people as well! And I just got back from their maternity leave; they handle it VERY well. Everything is done and communicated within one day of filing/uploading documents or emailing/calling them, and they offer an 8 week “ramp back” schedule for moms returning from maternity leave at a reduced 50% or 75% schedule. The pay is really good and now their insurance is amazing as well. Your schedule is set and the same every week, and payday is every Friday. Lots of time off options as well.","My fc was converted to a returns facility and the changes made have made this job so foreign to me. It’s almost as if they make it harder on purpose. They don’t listen to the feedback or desires of tier 1 employees at ALL EVER. Communication is abysmal, you never see your own manager and you’re lucky if you ever meet them nowadays. Their communicate everything if not through their app then on “inSTALLments” which are papers posted in the bathroom stalls. The place is nasty (it’s a warehouse so yeah it’s dirty) but it’s actually gross half the time. The clean up people socialize more than work. Most people don’t want to help you so you become afraid to ask. They don’t accept doctors notes or anything like that, and aren’t understanding of any missed time if you go over - I had a friend fired before a UPT drop because he hit a deer and lost his vehicle. A billion dollar company has so much room for improvement it’s insane. We break our backs and get crapped on more often than not.","Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"Jan. 3, 2023"

Anytime pay was cool.","PICK was physically demanding, with any position I've worked with rates (STOW, PICK, and PACK) they expect you to make rates that are under ten seconds when you have a decently long station, ladder to get up and down, and heavy items usually, while being virtually exact, and doing an all side check to make sure it isn't damaged. If you don't get both quality and time you get written up. The time to get to and from breaks is also unfair, it is from last scan to first scan, if you're far from the breakroom you get less of a break, they have mini ""break rooms"" that are just chairs no microwave or fridge. they have the mini actual break rooms on the same floors as the two main breakrooms, instead of the other two floors without breakrooms. They encourage using the restroom, but time of task can also get you written up or be considered time theft. Especially if you have to wait for one of the two toilets to be unoccupied or if you have to walk to a different floor. Station distance also plays a factor in that. Also the pay isn't worth the physical strain and damage to bodies. If you can't pay your bills, eat, and live independently off of back-breaking work. Just google all of the people that died on-site in different facilities for the straining work, plus mental stress, and unrealistic expectations on dedicated workers. Also they do not accommodate pregnant/nursing women properly. I seen men be able to get chairs to occasionally sit at a station, I asked for the same accommodation while pregnant, instead they told me I could take 6-8 unpaid 30 minute breaks a day, which is super unrealistic. I wanted to work, but I also wanted to do so safely considering I almost passed out twice, not go to work to not work and lose my apartment. So I had to choose between living on the streets as a pregnant women and my child's life and my health. Because of the terrible accommodations I didn't make it to maternity leave, I had to quit after being hospitalized, which I believe was their goal to not have to pay me for my leave. It's the same deal with nursing, you can pump, but you have to take 30 minute unpaid breaks which makes the pay not worth it, losing those hours meant not paying my bills so I had to sneak pump with a cordless pump while working.

empReview_73112473,Employee > Driver,1.0,Amazon,neutral,neutral,neutral,"Adventure, you get to go to places you'd probably never go to depending on your delivery area...for better or for worse. If you really have nowhere to turn in terms of finding employment, this job isn't the worst one out there. It really depends on the area you're delivering at and the company you sign up with (Amazon hires smaller companies to hire drivers, keep that in mind). But hear me now, you deserve better. Put in the time and effort to find the job you deserve because Amazon will not treat you like a person. They'll treat you like a mule. This should only be a job taken as a last resort.","In the years I've worked at Amazon being a delivery driver (since 2019), only one time can I say that Amazon has made a change for the Driver's benefit. Every other change they've made in a Driver's job has only made things more difficult to accomplish a route. Whether it's the rabbit app or the mentor app, everything in the company is designed in a meticulous way to create obstacles for the driver with no incentive to maintain their ridiculous level of standards. Except for not being fired. They'll ask you questions, look for your opinion but it's all placebos. Changes are not made to help drivers. I don't hate the people I directly work with. My dispatch is pretty awesome. But every day I live in fear that Amazon is going to introduce yet another rule or update to their apps to make delivering harder. The biggest con is that Amazon does not care about you as a person. As I said in the pros section, you're a mule, a robot, someone they'll squeeze every ounce of work out of and toss you aside when you can't work no more. I'm going to dive into some darker stories here during my time at Amazon so don't read on if you don't want to hear it. This is your warning. I'd heard that a delivery guy had gotten mauled to death by a couple of dogs. They didn't find his body till the morning. Which is awful since the vans are tracked. Should have found him that night. But I wasn't there so I can't say for certain what could and couldn't have been done. What I can say for certain is that the only thing Amazon did after this incident was add a little warning system on their app which allows drivers to report dogs at a location. I hope that man's family got something from Amazon as compensation but somehow I doubt it. I myself had gotten attacked by a dog, luckily not nearly as brutally as that man. It comes with the territory, sadly it can happen. But what infuriated me about the situation was not that I was attacked, but that I had been asking to get out of that dangerous area for a while. Despite my preferred area being somewhere else (I literally put in their system that I preferred a certain area) they continuously send me to a dangerous place that I am simply not cut out to do. And sure enough, I was attacked by a dog in this area. I'd hoped this would have shown them that yeah, maybe we should send this driver somewhere where they'll excel instead of fail but no, the next week they had me deliver to the same house I was attacked. There are also the write-ups you'll get because Amazon is too lazy to clean up its own messes. An Amazon locker I had to deliver to daily had its scanner broken meaning we have to type in the packages' individual codes which are 15 digits long. I had 40 packages for this locker which meant I had to type in 600 different characters. This of course was in the burning sun (live in the hotter part of the U.S.), and I still had a full route to complete after this. Luckily for me, I was able to deliver it to the campus mailroom instead of having to do all that. I called up Amazon Locker Services to have it fixed and they said they'd get it done so there'd be no future problems. This locker was on a college campus that consistently gets packages delivered to it so this is a problem I figured they'd want to take care of right away. This was months ago. Recently I found out a girl on our team found herself in the same situation and did the same as me. She got a 2nd tier writeup (there's only one above it) for not delivering to the locker. In other words, Amazon, unwilling to get the locker fixed, would rather you spend hours in the burning sun typing in 600 characters and complete your route afterward instead of simply fixing THEIR machine they'd been told is broken. And if you don't, then you're getting written up. There are so many more situations I could write about in my years working at Amazon but TLDR, you're expendable to them so don't expect to be treated in a humane way. You're a tool, nothing more. And you deserve more than that. Don't work here. Find something that will bring you joy, I promise you Amazon won't.","Current Employee, more than 3 years",,"Jan. 29, 2023"

They say they have a very ""peculiar"" culture, and they do. They are so obsessed with making sure you fit that culture that the entire FIVE HOURS of interviewing in one day is focused on you coming up with anecdotes that embody their ""Leadership Principles"" and getting grilled on them. There is close to zero discussion of your actual skills or experience, or of the actual requirements of the job or how the team operates or anything that would help you make a decision. I barely got my questions answered. And I was practically incoherent by the end of the day. That said, if you do your homework and type out a detailed doc with all your examples - 2 for each of 10 principles, you can get the job. I thought I did terribly and I got an offer 3 days later. Was it meaningful to me? No. Did it feel incredibly contrived and frustrating? Yes. But I needed a job in a down economy and felt this company wasn't going anywhere. I will be honest that had I had two offers on the table at once, I would have gone with the other one purely based on how much I hated the interview process. Once inside, I am adjusting to working at the biggest company ever with a ton of bureaucracy and very specific processes for how to do everything. Onboarding and getting to a place where you can contribute takes forever, and makes you really bored. Also, they are so behind other tech companies in terms of workplace tools. My coworkers literally email Word docs around to each other!! Static Word doc attachments!!! Oh, the version control issues!! Where is the Google Suite and dynamic docs, even the microsoft version of that? Nowhere to be seen. They use Quip (so bad!) and other terrible inferior things. They have Slack, but it's like a social chat, they haven't fully adopted it as a tool of efficiency and to replace email. SO MUCH EMAIL. That said, it's clear that if I accept it for what it is and stop banging my head against the wall trying to make it be what it's not, then this could be a great place to work, and great for my career. I have already noticed how mobile people are here. Folks stay a long time and change roles often; it's expected.

empReview_71881966,Not Bad,5.0,Amazon,positive,positive,positive,"Pros 1. Big problems - At Amazon, no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve. In fact, they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent, time and resources towards solving them. In my time there, pretty much every team I worked with was solving a ""holy grail"" problem in their field and actually making progress towards it. There is no dearth of interesting projects, teams or ideas to work on. 2. Structure and thinking - There is a lot of document writing at Amazon, in case you have not heard. While some people do not like that part of the job much, I think the required meetings and documents force every employee to truly think about their job and what they are doing. Producing the write-ups and getting them ready to face up to a room of very detailed scrutiny and questioning forces you to think through every aspect of your business. it is really a very valuable skill that Amazon does a great job of developing. 3. Ownership - Amazon treats you like an owner - a grown up. You have a job to do and you are empowered to do it. There are checks and balances, of course, but you truly do own your business. You make the assessments, take the risks, justify your decisions and ultimately reap the benefits or learn from your mistakes and move on. There are not many fall-backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward. Not a lot of finger poitning for failures either, that I saw. In fact, I would say that if you do not act like an owner, you will not be successful at Amazon. You have to embrace the responsibility and run with it. 4. Smart People - You'll hear this a lot and personally, I think some of the talk is overblown but Amazon does indeed have some very, very smart and talented people working there. I know its a cliche, but I did learn a lot from most people I worked with there - and again, I say, most, not all :-) are just genuinely nice people. I would work again with these people without hesitation. I think the leadership there is especially great - just really smart, experienced people with sharp instincts, great insights and lots of ambition. It was really fun working with the folks I did.","Cons 1. Structure and documentation - What I said above about structure and documentation, while its great to create clarity and shape your thinking, it can get in the way of actually doing your work. Everybody at Amazon is juggling so much and constantly writing high quality documents can get exhausting. The secret here, as in any job, is to balance the strategic against the operational and prioritize ruthlessly. I cannot say I was always effective at it - but I tried till my last day and now have the benefit of hind sight as well :-) 2. Culture - I think some people could have a tough time adjusting to the culture - its tough, expectations are high and there is not always a lot of hand holding ( in fact, it would be very rare). I think you have to embrace or at least accept it and focus on the positives. Your team makes a huge difference - so hopefully you're lucky and end up with a great manager and great team mates. If you're looking for free food and onsite massages - you certainly will be disappointed. You can end up overworked and resentful if you are not good at prioritizing your work and your life and making trade-offs. 3. People/Politics - I started to see a lot of the ""we are the best in the world"" mentality start to show up. I don't believe that everyone that works at Amazon is a genius and seeing that attitude crop up every now and then was annoying. Every company has inside politics and even though Amazon tries really hard to believe there is no politics, there is certainly that to deal with. No more than any other company that I can tell, but it can get frustrating when you're working so hard and so long to get derailed by that kind of thing. So there you have it - overall I loved my time at Amazon. I was exhausted (in a very good way) every day but couldn't wait to go back and keep making progress. I was lucky to have a great team, a really interesting area to work on and some awesome problems to tackle.","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Executive in Mumbai,"Dec. 15, 2022"

Have always heard negative things about Amazon culture, but after working here for three months, I have yet to see a culture of toxicity. Hopefully that continues into the future. Great work-life balance. I can take time if I need to. No one is breathing down my neck at this current juncture. I have a feeling this may change though as I become the owner of more things while working here. Generally, I am happy to work hard and help and feel recognized for such efforts. Oftentimes Amazon is seen as a no ""bells and whistles"" company, but I was (perhaps naively) pleasantly surprised with the quality of the work environment and food. I almost appreciate the frugality more than getting a bunch of free stuff.",Competition at Amazon amongst higher ranking individuals is often visibly harmful to communication and productivity. Though I get the feeling that this isn't an Amazon specific problem and more an artifact of how the rubber meets the road when business meets software. I imagine working as a software engineer could be a tad lonely if you do not already have a good support group. I see many engineer's whose lives revolve solely around their work for better or worse.

You will meet the best people here, unfortunately, the high ups don't interact with the associates who actually run Amazon, and their needs are subsided.","Overtime. During Peak last year I was working 65 hour work weeks with no overtime and no night differential. We were expected to put in 3x the work during the holiday season without any real benefit. As a manager, you don't get the perks that hourly employees get like two breaks, overtime, holiday pay, and any other benefits throughout the year. Management is separate from associates and has unbelievably high expectations for compensation that is.... let's say, not reflective of the work. It is no wonder the turnover is so high. The first 6 months of my job, I didn't take a lunch break because it was frowned upon to ever be off the floor. The second part of my tenure, I made sure I took a 30 minute break every night to eat and escape the craziness, but they told me that I shouldn't leave the building. Policing. I can't even describe how much of my time was wasted policing associates. I felt like a high school principal trying to get students in trouble. If you didn't give out enough written warnings every night, you had to go out of your way to look for people doing something wrong. So instead of helping my associates with problems they faced day to day, or working to achieve long term goals with them, or dedicating any time to fix the endless mechanical and technical problems faced on the daily, I had to spend my time going around my department trying to catch someone on their phone, or off task, or not doing their job in some other way. I used to have to go through everyone's time cards from the day before, find the people off task the most, and spend my time reprimanding the few strays who weren't doing their job, effectively ignoring the needs of all the associates who show up and do the right thing everyday. It was ridiculous and what made me lose my connections with the people, and therefore my work. Turnover. You could never get comfortable. As soon as you had a routine there were new associates, or new managers, or new ways to do the process, or new rules, or new write ups you had to give. It is a constantly revolving door that goes around and around without making any real progress. People were fired every day, and new people came in practically every week. No adjustment period, no getting comfortable, just work and work and work and pick up the pieces along the way. ""Do your best!"" they'd say, ""But I need to see more results"". I was constantly putting out fires on a sinking ship. Management. I was at Amazon for a little over a year, and I saw a multitude of leadership transitions. It's very cut-throat and I lost too many good leaders who moved to other jobs after not getting their well-deserved promotion. On the contrary, I had too many managers who were insufficient at their jobs and stayed in leadership positions simply because they were willing to be miserable for a paycheck. They cared about themselves, their careers, their opportunities, and ABOVE ALL, how YOU made them look to THEIR bosses. I would be on the floor, making real time quick decisions based on what I thought was best for the associates and operation, and I would be reprimanded because some higher up across the country looking at a screen of data, didn't like that decision, didn't think it was worth it, didn't see the positive result in the performance data. I constantly had to compete safety with performance instead of wholly prioritizing safety and putting performance on the back burner until the situation is resolved. Amazon is a giant company, and unfortunately, to a giant company, its all a numbers game. I used to defend Amazon, I wanted to be the difference, I wanted to change the narrative.... boy was I naive. I quickly learned that I was caring for my people way more than any manager was caring for me. And that being a good leader didn't get you recognized or praised, being a good manager did. A good manager does the reports on time and listens to their boss and does what is best for the company. A good leader looks out for their people and creates a team environment in which we can all thrive. I created a beautiful synergy in my first department on my own, I was a great leader and the associates would tell you they loved me. In my second department, I wasn't given the time or freedom to create meaningful relationships and was forced to go into strictly manager mode. Listen to your boss and do what you're told, even if you don't think its the right thing to do for the people. Working with people, especially the number of people I was working with (100+), requires a certain level of nuance. I was working with all different ages, ethnicities, backgrounds, and financial situations, and as easy as it would be to throw a blanket over everyone and treat them the same, there's no equity in that.

The work is exhausting but the worst part is when you get promoted and the human managers decide to put extra pressure on you for no reason and I've even been yelled at by my supervisor for not doing something specific at a certain time even if I had 6 hours to spare. This whole place loses its charm when the human managers don't try to help you and don't even respect you. If you wanna make money this is the place.

I worked full-time on the receiving line in a warehouse that processed large items (up to 50 pounds). The items keep coming from the conveyor belt, and the work of a receiver involves scanning this items and placing them into special cages that are used for moving the items into storage spaces. This repetitive cage filling is done non-stop , 10 hours a day with half an hour of paid break and half an hour unpaid (at $15/hr). All the associates were either immigrants that probably don't have many  options and/or folks with urgent need for money. If you are working as an associate, try to make an effort and get some qualifications to move on afterwards. There are plenty of positions that are not as demanding on your body and pay better.

empReview_20509084,Avoid! Job will give you anxiety & depression.,1.0,Amazon,negative,positive,negative,Work 4 days and get 3 days off. Nice extended health benefits.,"Avoid working at a fulfillment center! Turnover rates are ridiculous, I should have backed out from my in-person interview when I was informed about the turnover rate. I should have seen the red flags. For example, working for 2 years makes you 'senior'. I wish I didn't accept the job, but I was desperate. You will be overworked. You will be rushed. You will be stressed. You will feel underappreciated. You will feel like you are underpaid. You will be made to feel unqualified.

They start you off with slow menial tasks and responsibilities. Before you know it, you're taking the load of the whole team and they see how you perform under stress. I've seen people cry at work (or in their cars), work so much they didn't have time to use the washroom, or work right through their lunch. 

Numbers/metrics are everything to the company, everything matters to the second. You will be tested. Yes, you heard that right! YOU WILL BE TESTED!

Workers will come up to you with questions to see how you answer them. Events will be staged to see how you react to them. I swear to God I wish I was making this up, but events were literally staged in front of me to see how I would handle them. There's a saying, Amazon has a peculiar way of doing things. Only 'Amazonians' will truly understand that. There's no other way to put it.

By the end of my employment, I was a nervous wreck. I had 0 confidence or motivation. I was making mistakes left, right, and center. I was bullied by management and my peers. I was berated. I was indirectly told to 'bully' others (see example below). I didn't pass some of their 'tests'. I was working 60 hours a week and was receiving 0 appreciation. I began having panic attacks. I couldn't tell which event would be staged to 'test' me or which was real. I began having depression. My last day of employment was the happiest moment. I was scared because I didn't know how I would afford bread the next day.

But, I still made it out of that hell-hole.

Example: I was asked to drop off a cart of products to a specific line of packers. When I asked why that specific line, I was told ""Ah, I want them to work harder."" When I walked by the first line, the workers were working at a slow and relaxed pace with barely any product coming to them. When I walked by the 2nd line where I was told to drop off the cart (there were already 4-6 carts waiting), all the workers there were rushing and sweating, they were clearly under stress, look panicked, and were obviously either being tested or purposefully overworked to quit.","Former Employee, less than 1 year","Toronto, ON","May 9, 2018"

- work with tons of smart people
- fantastic build and deployment tools compared to other software shops - needs to be great to work at Amazon scale. If you think you need a tool chances are someones already built it
- your developer box is in the cloud - whatever hardware you need for the job it’s there
- decent pay compared to others in Vancouver, for the first while anyways
- Vancouver teams strive to have good work life balance
- since your experience is heavily dependent on your management chain and so many teams with open head count, if your current team is not a fit there is probably another team that is. Internal movement is encouraged (better to keep you at Amazon than lose you)
- Amazon values arent just words - they live and breathe the values. Customer obsession is key.
- you’re building at the bleeding edge of the cloud. Some really cool stuff at incredible scale gets built, and more often than not you can be proud of what you build","- though Vancouver office strives for work life balance, politics from Seattle come into play - can be perception that you’re “doing less work” even if its just better planning.
- hard to get visibility with management chain in Seattle - if you’re not constantly putting out fires you’re not visible and delivering
- not so good long term retention - lot of people churn (benefit of this is getting to know the smart people and where they are going)
- after signing bonus is up, bonuses afterwards are underwhelming - many just stick it out until vested
- stress from on call rotation - you’re not just a developer but you’re also the one who gets paged when software your team owns breaks (rotates among the team). Good in theory to get issues and customer problems resolved quickly, but adds a lot more stress to an already fast paced environment.
- Good luck getting promoted, especially if you’re in Vancouver and someone in Seattle needs to approve it.

I had to literally beg my manager for a task that involved writing code 8 months into my work period.  My teammates did not treat my work with urgency when it came to code reviews and design reviews, causing delays which were blamed on me but were not preventable.  I had to learn proprietary internal systems that had little to no documentation without any assistance from my team (I was reprimanded when I asked for assistance), and whatever documentation did exist was frequently out of date, lacking important details, or just factually inaccurate.  Amazon treats these issues in documentation as ""ambiguity"" and the company culture is not to encourage people to make sure the documentation is accurate, but rather to fix holes and issues only when a problem is found, causing frustration.

Subsequent to leaving the company, I was treated with extreme disrespect when claiming my legal entitlements such as my Record of Employment to file for Employment Insurance as well as contractually allowed company expenses that were filed after leaving.","Former Employee, less than 1 year","Toronto, ON","Dec. 28, 2017"

empReview_72587888,I love working for Amazon--and I'm really not trying to leave but…,5.0,Amazon,positive,error,error,"Only thing that I can say—that's clear —is the Amazon internal structure was designed from the beginning to ""take care"" of its employees...and (pardon the pun) but, Amazon delivers. Pay is fair to excellent;  benefits are active from day one; there’s usually as much overtime as anyone would want, promotions, bonuses, access to stock purchases, paid training for extra certifications and qualifications etc. A day after working hard at Amazon is well felt when one arrives home to spend quiet evenings with loved ones.","Huge, huge company; sometimes Amazon feels unmanageable; cultures vary between facilities and regions. Work environment (behavioral culture) can lack esteem, pride and generally optimistic credence and/or proactivity. This is highly variable however--most facilities have a decent work culture but parts of Amazon are very transient due to the size of Amazon. Management is civil and required to exercise maturity when dealing with employees; regardless of other reviews the truth about Amazon is that the leadership (management cannot be abusive to employees under any circumstances; Amazon policy is to terminate abusive management or demote with impunity) however, management does play games ( and they know it) with other employees especially when earned promotions are due; promotions (that are due) may be obstructed and/or outright prevented usually in the name of exclusivity. 
Organizational cohesion is a real challenge at Amazon and very difficult to maintain due to the size of Amazon (however, it is not impossible to achieve and Amazon provides the necessary training to achieve it). While the next aspect is not overwhelming or prohibitive from enjoying working for amazon it is noticeable: sometimes Amazon's culture feels completely unmanageable and most internal employees will experience a feeling of being excluded a/o generally forgotten. Self sufficiency and autonomy of employees is requisite for all employees yet this is a tacit expectation that is not emphasized enough compared to the practicalities of the typical Amazon work environments. Amazon is actually not a company that will cooperate with employees who are exploring resignation options--meaning that if an employee is an established performer at Amazon and is considering changing jobs Amazon may actively obstruct the resignation in some manner.","Current Employee, more than 5 years",,"Jan. 13, 2023"

I was very nervous about joining Amazon because of its reputation of being a Toxic environment, unfortunately, in my experience it is worse than I expected; high stress, unreasonable demands on employees, out of touch management, they claim work-life-balance, just empty words, they will pile on so much work on you where it's impossible to do nothing but work. I wanted to quit after my 2nd month there. No one cares about you, from the day 1 it's sink or swim, no one will train you, you have to figure things out on your own, and if you make a mistake, it's all over for you. Super high turnover, in 6months I was on my 2nd manager, 3rd director, most of my teammates are new, less than a year, and already miserable. All of the rumors you read/hear are true in my experience. Maybe I just had bad luck and landed on the wrong team, but I doubt it. Amazon pays you a sign on bonus in a lump sum in year 1 as an incentive not to quit within your first 12 months as an attempt to lower turnover rate If you resign you'll have to pay it back prorated, so if you join, demand that your sign on bonus is paid monthly.

Remote friendly. - Internal politics can be tiresome but generally at lower levels you can ignore them, this is also easier now with full remote. - Another benefit of full remote: don’t have to interact with highly “Amazonian” managers and PMs in person who are bouncing off the wall making requests and asking status updates at your desk, team room, common areas, and lunch.","- Working here cultivates apathy. I see a lot of talented and passionate people morph into lifeless drones. This can be due to uninspiring projects, non-stimulating work, or perhaps other reasons. - Some huge egos at higher levels that are difficult to work with and generally unpleasant to be around (will speak condescendingly and even say explictly that other teams and coworkers are idiots, useless, etc.) - Paging system of auto-escalation is designed to glue you to computer during shift or else risk an escalation to directors and VPs. - Overload of documents surrounding career growth and metrics, such as level guidelines and leadership principles. You constantly have to be documenting and discussing this. This could be a pro for some people. However these metrics can detract from doing your job well and making the most impact for customers. - Amazon tends to attract more “ladder climber” types than other companies. Probably not the best place for someone who wants to just focus on getting work done in peace. You may have to pretend you care about climbing the Amazon corporate ladder else your manager will think you’re coasting and manage you out. - Related: managers tend to be under a lot of stress due to broken systems they’re forced to comply with. You can read more about this elsewhere. They generally do their best to shield employees from this. One of my former managers consistently appeared to be under a great deal of stress.

You will not know how many packages you have to deliver in a day until you pull up into the warehouse to pick them up. This usually means you have no idea the number of hours you will pull in a day. You could be done in 5 or you are working 10-12 hours. You are basically on your own all day and if you are delivering in the city the headache of trying to get into buildings as well as walking several flights of stairs due to nonexistent or broken elevators is commonplace. Regardless of if you are in the city or a suburb, you are supposed to keep a set pace when delivering that is tracked by the app. DSPs are notoriously very all over the place when it comes to standards of work so really expect the worst when it comes to anything.","Former Employee, less than 1 year","Bronx, NY","Dec. 27, 2022"

Because of the holidays getting a leave of absence is impossible. I got approved for a LOA 12/27 for the earliest date of 1/11/23. My employment was terminated on 1/6/23 due to excessive use of personal time. I was on flex schedule and I would pick up days and use my personal to hold me over for the week and a half until my leave started or I get money to get my car fixed. Which ever came first. I got approved for a loan the day I got fired. I was in communication with the employee resource center and the local HR team since the night I had to desert my car on the side of the highway. I was told I had options, but the local team was slow to respond and I was told via email there is no phone number; I had to just wait for someone to reach out to me. Next thing I know, I'm terminated. I appealed the decision stating I've done what I can on my end in hopes to reinstate my employment. I was denied. I have the opportunity to reapply in 90 days, but I can't work for a company that doesn't care about me. I was in the career choice program going to school for my bachelor's and now I can't continue my studies. I don't know anywhere that I can rent making $8/hr.

That was the case with myself and our team and the significance was two-fold. 

First, a shock to me, Amazon is very a vertical, management top-heavy organization. This fact flies in the face of a supposed hallowed IT tenet, ""lean"" structure. Whatever type of company the B-man intended to create, it is not flat. Independent, self-directed work is tolerated up to a point, but it eventually gets funneled through a micro-managed sieve of oversight, mainly due to the fact there are so many managers in need of justifying their existence. 

Second, we were a team of knowledge workers supporting legal and regulatory compliance requirements during Amazon's rollout of its dedicated road logistics operations, being led by managers with community college diplomas and GEDs recruited from Fed-Ex and Amazon FCs. 

It quickly became a farce within a firestorm of mis-management inside incompetence wrapped in angst and distrust. Of course (it became apparent) Amazon had a two- or perhaps a three-way door built into this highly risky and costly bet, and in retrospect our team, along with the venture itself, was a longshot to make the backstretch. 

Amazon pulled the plug on any aspect of owning it's own fleet of dedicated drivers before year-two of my stay. Despite this decision, delivery and logistics and its runaway costs is still the fly in the chardonnay of the company's hope to ever achieve a consistent, substantial profit in its retail operations. 

And so much for the frugality myth. They paid over $30K just for me to relocate to Seattle.

They will come back and say this is what we offer, however let them know you have done market research and for the skills and stuff you need that extra hike/money, they will budge, it will take a week but will happen (personal experience) Office is great, Location: Multiple depends on which city you are from. I am from BLR, my office is located in Bagmane, Food is average however at low cost Everything you do/about to do revolves around Leadership principles, You eat and breathe leadership principles Culture wise since people are exceptional and friendly, takes sometime to get used to and trust people Career opportunities are great and need to spend sometime in role and then basis performance promotions happen","No cons observed so far, Like REALLY!

If you have some issues and your ratings drop, they will come to you asking why you are slow. Note, they are very very pushy and work here is very stressful physically. They care nothing about your health, they even want you to run and pick and pack, without a single minute to take a breath.

You go to the toilet, they come to ask why there's a gap. You have some issues with your work station and took some time to fix it and your ratings drop, they come to ask why you were slow. This is a place where they try all their best to extract every value from you, and try all the best to pay the least to you. Amazon is a bad employer and very mean and greedy, from the top CEO to the bottom PA and managers. If you have another choice, go.

When you start to work, there's always a questionnaire on the screen, asking something like ""is the break room crowded"" or ""does the manager treat you like a number, rather than a person""... You see these hilarious and pathetic questions? It's just because the managers care nothing about his workers and only treat them as some unknow number, that they try to ask like this. The break room is always crowded, always. People get sick and contracted Covid-19 in the break room when having lunch.

Worst aspect is always from the managers and process assistant's side. They never knew how to motivate an associate worker. If you work really fast, then they are happy because bonus comes to them not you. If you work slow for some reason, they will jump and come instantly. Sometimes they even fire people right on the spot. Nobody is happy here except the managers and PAs. Don't forget, you cannot go to the washroom for some more minutes. They don't allow. They said you won't need that much time to p-o-o-p. Because they p-o-o-p fast, so you should also p-o-o-p fast.

Lastly, almost NO people work here for a long time. Most of them, nearly 90% are new hires who worked no more than 1 year. Amazon fires people fast and is very mean. Whenever there's no more work or the future prospect orders is decreasing, they fire.","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Brampton, ON","Feb. 11, 2021"

Through recent job cuts, there have been business changes which fly in the face of everything we have worked to build up: longer term bets over short term productivity. It's dressed up as ""ensuring no one in our team gets cut"", but it's hand-in-hand with an attempt to ensure senior managers don't lose scope and decelerate their own promotion attempts. The area where I work is hamstrung by a toxic cycle, whereby in order to get promoted, you have to increase your ""span of control"" i.e. ensure that the number of people under you grows past a certain point and never dips below it.

empReview_72389202,HIGHLY Recommend for HR,5.0,Amazon,positive,positive,positive,"I HIGHLY recommend Amazon as an employer, particularly operating in the field, to fast track your career and enhance your career experience. Amazon is the only company I have experienced that TRULY lives their leadership principles- it is what your annual review, touch bases, promotions, terminations, projects, everything is based on. From these values, you will know exactly what a successful Amazonian looks like. Amazon enhances employees development by sending employees to launch sites or sites in need of additional help. They also have temporary teams built that you can take part of to learn to specialize, such as employee relations. They want to promote people quickly and from within as often as possible. If you want to try something and you can present a solid reason why, they are willing to invest in you. This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. If you are willing to put in the work, you can triple your salary (or more with stock options) in 5 years. I was able to double mine in 2.5 years. Had I not wanted to own a business, I would have stayed with Amazon for much longer. If my business fails, I would go back to Amazon in a heartbeat.","I firmly believe you have to be in the right time of your life to support Amazon warehouses. I would not work at Amazon if I had a children and/or prioritized work/life balance (depending on your position- in this case HR manager (L6) or below). I would recommend it if you're single or a fresh college graduate. In the field (aka warehouses), you will work 55+ hours per work, can be responsible for any shift, and the PTO policy isn't great ( if you have a good boss they can make up for that). You will have a lot of managers at Amazon- some AMAZING and others TERRIBLE, there is no in between. If you want to promote FAST, you will have to relocate to support launches. That being said, you can still promote quickly in your location, but it will be faster in 1) a larger site (2000+ people) and/or 2) a geographical area saturated with sites (ex. southern California). It is a stressful job, but you will learn a lot in a VERY short period of time. When and if you are ready to leave the warehouses/field operations, there are so MANY opportunities and business lines to explore. I did this and found myself missing the grind of the warehouses immensely. Specifically for HR, I would try to join Amazon as an HRBP vs. HR Partner if you have experience in HR (2+ years). If you are new to HR and serious about a career in it, I would recommend starting as an HR partner and grinding away (keep in mind- this may require swing/night shifts). There are people that have been promoted 4-5 times in 5-7 years from a position like that. Overall, if you want to grind in your career (you could be VP status by 30 if you're lucky) and work/life balance isn't a priority- Amazon is a good fit for you. It's not a bad thing- it's just a fit for a certain type of person. --",Former Employee,,"Jan. 6, 2023"

empReview_71723484,A good company,4.0,Amazon,positive,positive,positive,"Amazon is a great place to work for a number of reasons. Some of the best reasons to work at Amazon include: Opportunities for growth and advancement. Amazon is a fast-paced and dynamic company with a strong focus on innovation and personal development. Working at Amazon offers numerous opportunities to learn new skills, take on challenging projects, and advance your career. Competitive compensation and benefits. Amazon offers competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance, retirement savings plans, and generous parental leave. Work-life balance. Amazon values its employees and understands the importance of work-life balance. The company offers flexible work arrangements and support for employees to pursue their personal interests and hobbies. Collaborative and inclusive culture. Amazon is known for its collaborative and inclusive culture, which encourages employees to work together to achieve common goals. The company fosters a sense of community and belonging among its employees, and provides opportunities for them to connect and engage with each other. Positive impact on the world. Amazon is a global company with a strong commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. Working at Amazon gives you the opportunity to contribute to the company's positive impact on the world and make a difference in the communities where it operates.","Like any company, Amazon has its share of downsides. Some of the potential drawbacks of working at Amazon include: Fast-paced and demanding environment. Amazon is known for its intense and demanding work environment. The company expects a lot from its employees and expects them to be able to handle high levels of pressure and work long hours. This can be challenging for some people and may not be the right fit for everyone. Limited work-life balance. While Amazon does offer flexible work arrangements and support for employees to pursue their personal interests, the fast-paced nature of the company can make it difficult for some employees to achieve a good work-life balance. High expectations and performance pressure. Amazon has high expectations for its employees and expects them to perform at a high level. This can create pressure for employees to constantly deliver and can be stressful for some people. Intense competition. Amazon is a highly competitive company, and employees may face intense competition for promotions, opportunities, and recognition. This can create a cutthroat atmosphere and may not be conducive to a positive work environment for some people. Limited opportunities for career development. While Amazon does offer opportunities for growth and advancement, some employees may find that their career development is limited by the company's focus on short-term results and its intense work environment.","Former Employee, more than 1 year","York, NY","Dec. 8, 2022"

You will get name-brand recognition from a big company.
Some of the people you work with are really smart.","1. Too much micromanagement
2. Too much survelance 
3. You can't really take vacation as you can be fired when you come back for not meeting a deadline by yourself
4. 11 hrs a day is normal for software engineers on weekdays and a lot of work on weekend along with oncall pager duty almost every night of the oncall week that comes ever 3-4 weeks usually.
5. If your manager does not like you they can block your internal team transfer.
6. Amazon practices stack ranking so even if you are an awesome engineer you will be compared to everyone else in your team and eventually fired
7. Pay is good but not as good as it should be.
8. People will step on your hands to climb the corporate ladder even if you are just trying to do your job and not really outrun anyone else.
9. All code review request revisions are averaged out so if you push multiple revisions of each code review request, you will be given hell in annual review.
10. Once you receive the rating as NI - needs improvement, no matter how much you improve, your life will be hell at Amazon. Based on last years improvement being NI, you will be denied any raise in your upcoming year.
11. Vesting schedule is substandard, only 5% after first year and 15% after second year which means they already know that you will leave within the first 2 years.
12. If you leave before finishing 2 years at Amazon, they will not give you their portion of RRSP/401k contribution.
13. Managers treat you badly in daily standup and other meetings if you are not their favourite.
14. Their culture is really toxic and your teammates are not willing to, or rather penalized to help you.
15. Ramp up is a nightmare, as you will be expected to know everything within the first week and the documentation does not help at all.
16. In order to get promotion, people have created more than the needed number of solutions to do the exact same thing and shamefully defend it saying its different when actually its not.
17. New grads are treated the worst, with literally no work life balance.
18. H1B visa is abused by Amazon as people are brought from all over the world and then fired after 6 months, leaving them 2 months to find a new job or to leave the country.
19. HR is not helpful as they are there to protect the company and 99.99% of the time will take the manager's side.
20. Some people are just hired to fire so the rest of the team can watch it happen and is scared for their job so they work harder.
21. Examples of the above point can be found in the communities inside phone tool in amazon where former employees who got fired due to these policies. They have changed there name to (piped) , pip meaning they were put on performance improvement plan which is Amazon's fancy name for managing an employee out.
22. Highly recommend to not even consider Amazon for interviews.","Current Employee, more than 1 year","Vancouver, BC","Aug. 11, 2021"

Day one benefits, easy internal transfers, day care resources, tuition reimbursement, as well as schedules that allow you to get more than the traditional two days off a week.","Even though the company provides many benefits, my experience there was awful. Much like other females working in a warehouse/manufacturing environment, I was sexually harassed many times by water-spiders. However, my manager was very understanding and did the best she could to make it a more comfortable and safe environment for me, and I'm grateful for her taking my concerns seriously. The work itself treats you like an actual robot. You do the same tasks ad nauseam for 10-12 hours (depending on your schedule). I'm someone who likes to use her brain. The tasks were far too monotonous and at times, it was drove me insane. The time off policy is incredibly rigid and unforgiving. If you are negative even a single hour in your unpaid time off bank, it could mean an automatic termination. You aren't even able to explain your situation. Can't believe I have to say this, but SAFETY was something I didn't think I'd have to worry about. We had a gun threat to the building and was told that we had to stay. And I'm sure some of you would say ""just leave,"" but with the strict time off policy, some didn't have the time to leave without getting fired the next day. It took many hours for management to finally decide to send everyone home. Another instance was the blizzard that hit the Midwest. There was a lack of communication from the head of warehouse at our location. He was pathetic enough to stay home, SAFE with family while the rest of us had to come in as he refused to shut down even though state officials told everyone else to stay home. Is there a more pathetic leader than Doug from DSM5? Can't say... These people hound their workers for having an earphone in to not make working at Amazon the most MISERABLE experience, but forcing people to stay under gun threat and come in during a blizzard is safe somehow. The safety committee is a fake and power hungry position. Awful PXT team. I am a student who needed a schedule accomodation. The company ""advocates"" for students and their wellbeing but also makes it very difficult to get an accommodation. The company allows students to cut up to ten hours off their weekly schedule while I only asked for two, but was denied twice even WITH the proper documents and proof of my schedule. Overall work culture. It's warehouse job. Some enjoy manufacturing, but it's not for everyone. Managers have favorites and the rest are nothing but expendable robots. If I'm spending a lot of time at a company and sacrificing my school/study time for it, I at least expect to be treated as a human being. I doubt that's asking for much. But Amazon has one of the largest turnover rates and I should've known going in with that knowledge that there is a reason why people can't stay regardless of the benefits and pay. The job chipped away at my happiness and began bleeding into other aspects of my life. I've never felt SO relieved resigning from another company as much as Amazon.","Former Employee, less than 1 year",,"Jan. 31, 2023"

Great benefits - medical, life insurance, 401k, etc.","UPT can be a very slippery slope - use your time wisely because you never know when you'll have an unexpected emergency and suddenly you are over your allotted ed personal time - and this is where it gets tricky: depending on the time of year (peak, vs non-peak) you could easily skate by with negative hours for months, but come peak season you will be mass terminated with all of your fellow negative UPTers. During peak there is a termination FREEZE. Due to volume needs, you can pretty much get away with anything. I wish I was lying. Another major con is that there are instant termination causes and depending on who caught you screwing up, you can either still have your job, or not. Why does this suck? Because it's completely subjective and has nothing to do with your quality as an employee most of the time. Favorites are a thing, But if you're one of those lucky few that get away with everything, good onya. Another very large con is consistency in messaging. There is a very large problem with communication - it either doesn't happen, happens in a vacuum, or isn't disseminated throughly leaving staff and teams on completely different pages and eventually causes severe breakdowns in the flow of work. Along with inconsistent messaging, they also have a habit of over promising and underdelivering for their staff. Roles are promised and never materialize. Raises are promised and don't happen. It's not everywhere all the time, but I've trained multiple level 4-5 managers as a level 1 and was often put in situations where my work well exceeding my role and salary. I was consistently working as a level 5, but only being paid a level 1 salary with many unmet promises on the horizon.","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Pontiac, MI","Dec. 14, 2022"

Every sentence you say needs to contain data if you want to succeed, which builds strong communications skills for any career in the 21st century.","Cut-throat management and toxic culture, unnecessary pressure and long hours for every tiny KPI that is not perfect out of the 1000. Some of these KPIs have not improved on any of the hundreds of fulfillment centers for over a year but all the managers have lost countless hours of sleep and stress because of pressure to improve them. I received the highest level of performance reviews but still it was never good enough, always could have done more, could have done it sooner, could have taken less time, could have done it during the weekend instead of waiting until Monday. They will also remind you every week about performance reviews to push you to stay at your 110% non-stop. Holidays are working days without hesitation. Expectation was to be available for texts and calls any time from 7am to 11pm on weekdays and during the day on weekends. Worked no less than 65hrs / week but far worst pay than comparable jobs with these expectations. At the end of the day, it wasn’t worth it for the value proposition this job is offering.
